It is an open alternative to using a proprietary HCI stack that incorporates the design and ethos of Cloud Native Computing . Harvester Features \u00b6 Harvester implements HCI on bare metal servers. Harvester is designed to use local, direct attached storage instead of complex external SANs. It ships as an integrated bootable appliance image that can be deployed directly to servers through an ISO or PXE boot artifact. Some notable features of Harvester include the following: VM lifecycle management including SSH-Key injection, cloud-init, and graphic and serial port console VM live migration support Supported VM backup and restore Distributed block storage Multiple network interface controllers (NICs) in the VM connecting to the management network or VLANs Virtual Machine and cloud-init templates Rancher integration with multi-cluster management and the Harvester node driver PXE/iPXE boot support Virtual IP and bond NIC support Monitoring integration Harvester Architecture \u00b6 The following diagram outlines a high-level architecture of Harvester: Longhorn is a lightweight, reliable and easy-to-use distributed block storage system for Kubernetes. KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. Elemental for openSUSE Leap 15.3 is a Linux distribution designed to remove as much OS maintenance as possible in a Kubernetes cluster. Hardware Requirements \u00b6 To get the Harvester server up and running, the following minimum hardware is required: Type Requirements CPU x86_64 only. Hardware-assisted virtualization is required. 8-core processor minimum; 16-core or above preferred Memory 32 GB minimum; 64 GB or above preferred Disk Capacity 140 GB minimum; 500 GB or above preferred Disk Performance 5,000+ random IOPS per disk (SSD/NVMe). Management nodes (first three nodes) must be fast enough for etcd . Network Card 1 Gbps Ethernet minimum; 10Gbps Ethernet recommended Network Switch Trunking of ports required for VLAN support Quick start \u00b6 You can install Harvester via the ISO installation or the PXE boot installation. Instructions are provided in the sections below. ISO Installation \u00b6 You can use the ISO to install Harvester directly on the bare metal server to form a Harvester cluster. Users can add one or many compute nodes to join the existing cluster. To get the Harvester ISO, download it from the Github releases . During the installation, you can either choose to form a new cluster or join the node to an existing cluster. Mount the Harvester ISO disk and boot the server by selecting the Harvester Installer . Choose the installation mode by either creating a new Harvester cluster or by joining an existing one. Choose the installation device on which the Harvester cluster will be installed Note: By default, Harvester uses GPT partitioning schema for both UEFI and BIOS. If you use the BIOS boot, then you will have the option to select MBR . Configure the hostname and select the network interface for the management network. By default, Harvester will create a bonded NIC named harvester-mgmt , and the IP address can either be configured via DHCP or a static assigned one (Note: The NODE IP can not change at the lifecycle of a Harvester cluster, in case the DHCP is used, user must make sure the DHCP server always offers the same IP for the same NODE. A changed NODE IP will cause the related NODE can not join the cluster, or even break the cluster) . Optional: Configure the DNS servers; use commas as delimiters. Configure the Virtual IP which you can use to access the cluster or join other nodes to the cluster (Note: If your IP address is configured via DHCP, you will need to configure static MAC-to-IP address mapping on your DHCP server in order to have a persistent Virtual IP, VIP must be different than any NODE IP) . Configure the cluster token . This token will be used for adding other nodes to the cluster. Configure the login password of the host. The default SSH user is rancher . Recommended configuring the NTP server to make sure all nodes' times are synchronized. This defaults to 0.suse.pool.ntp.org . (Optional) If you need to use an HTTP proxy to access the outside world, enter the proxy URL address here. Otherwise, leave this blank. (Optional) You can choose to import SSH keys from a remote server URL. Your GitHub public keys can be used with https://github.com/<username>.keys . (Optional) If you need to customize the host with a Harvester configuration file, enter the HTTP URL here. Confirm the installation options and Harvester will be installed to your host. The installation may take a few minutes to complete. Once the installation is complete, the host will restart, and a console UI with management URL and status will be displayed. (You can Use F12 to switch between the Harvester console and the Shell). The default URL of the web interface is https://your-virtual-ip . Users will be prompted to set the password for the default admin user at first login. PXE/iPXE Installation \u00b6 Harvester can also be installed automatically. Please refer to PXE Boot Install for detailed instructions and additional guidance. Note More iPXE usage examples are available at harvester/ipxe-examples .","title":"Harvester Overview"},{"location":"#harvester-overview","text":"Harvester is an open-source hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) software built on Kubernetes.

Valid configuration fields are: method : Method to assign an IP to this network. The following are supported: static : Manually assign an IP and gateway. dhcp : Request an IP from the DHCP server. none : Do nothing. Useful when the interface does not need an IP, such as when creating VLAN network NIC in Harvester. ip : Static IP for this network. Required if static method is chosen. subnet_mask : Subnet mask for this network. Required if static method is chosen. gateway : Gateway for this network. Required if static method is chosen. interfaces : An array of interface names. If provided, the installer then combines these NICs into a single logical bonded interface. interfaces.name : The name of the slave interface for the bonded network. bond_options : Options for bonded interfaces. Refer to here for more info. If not provided, the following options would be used: mode: balance-tlb miimon: 100 mtu : The MTU for the interface. Note A network called harvester-mgmt is mandatory to establish a valid management network . Note Harvester uses the systemd net naming scheme . Please make sure the interface name is present on the target machine before installation. Example \u00b6 install : mode : create networks : harvester-mgmt : # The management bond name. This is mandatory. interfaces : - name : ens5 method : dhcp bond_options : mode : balance-tlb miimon : 100 mtu : 1492 harvester-vlan : # The VLAN network bond name. User can then input `harvester-vlan` in the VLAN NIC setting in the GUI. interfaces : - name : ens6 method : none bond_options : mode : balance-tlb miimon : 100 bond0 : interfaces : - name : ens8 method : static ip : 10.10.18.2 subnet_mask : 255.255.255.0 gateway : 192.168.11.1 mtu : 9000 install.force_efi \u00b6 Force EFI installation even when EFI is not detected.

Example \u00b6 install : tty : ttyS0,115200n8 install.vip \u00b6 install.vip_mode \u00b6 install.vip_hw_addr \u00b6 Definition \u00b6 install.vip : The VIP of the Harvester management endpoint. After installation, users can access the Harvester GUI at the URL https://<VIP> . install.vip_mode dhcp : Harvester will send DHCP requests to get the VIP. The install.vip_hw_addr field needs to be provided. static : Harvester uses a static VIP. install.vip_hw_addr : The hardware address corresponding to the VIP. Users must configure their on-premise DHCP server to offer the configured VIP. The field is mandatory when install.vip_mode is dhcp . See Management Address for more information. Example \u00b6 Configure a static VIP. install : vip : 192.168.0.100 vip_mode : static Configure a DHCP VIP. install : vip : 10.10.0.19 vip_mode : dhcp vip_hw_addr : 52:54:00:ec:0e:0b install.force_mbr \u00b6 Definition \u00b6 By default, Harvester uses GPT partitioning scheme on both UEFI and BIOS systems. However, if you face compatibility issues, the MBR partitioning scheme can be forced on BIOS systems. Note Harvester creates an additional partition for storing VM data if install.data_disk is configured to use the same storage device as the one set for install.device . When force using MBR, no additional partition will be created and VM data will be stored in a partition shared with the OS data. Example \u00b6 install : force_mbr : true install.data_disk \u00b6 Available as of v1.0.1 Definition \u00b6 Sets the default storage device to store the VM data. Default: Same storage device as the one set for install.device Example \u00b6 install : data_disk : /dev/sdb system_settings \u00b6 Definition \u00b6 You can overwrite the default Harvester system settings by configuring system_settings . See the Settings page for additional information and the list of all the options. Note Overwriting system settings only works when Harvester is installed in \"create\" mode. If you install Harvester in \"join\" mode, this setting is ignored. Installing in \"join\" mode will adopt the system settings from the existing Harvester system. Example \u00b6 The example below overwrites http-proxy and ui-source settings. The values must be a string . system_settings : http-proxy : '{\"httpProxy\": \"http://my.proxy\", \"httpsProxy\": \"https://my.proxy\", \"noProxy\": \"some.internal.svc\"}' ui-source : auto cluster_networks \u00b6 Available as of v1.0.1 Definition \u00b6 You can setup the default network in Harvester by configuring cluster_networks . Network configuration reference: vlan : Setup for VLAN network. The following fields are supported: enable : enable VLAN network settings or not. Default value: false . description : Additional information for ClusterNetworks . Default value: \"\". config : ClusterNetworks configuration to be used. Valid configuration fields are: defaultPhysicalNIC (string, required): assign a physical NIC to be external entry of VLAN network. Note To configure the cluster_networks , Harvester needs to be installed in \"create\" mode. If you install Harvester in \"join\" mode, this setting is ignored. Installing in \"join\" mode will apply the cluster_networks configuration from the existing Harvester system. Example \u00b6 The following example sets the default physical NIC name of the VLAN network: cluster_networks : vlan : enable : true description : \"some description about this cluster network\" config : defaultPhysicalNIC : ens3","title":"Harvester Configuration"},{"location":"install/harvester-configuration/#harvester-configuration","text":"","title":"Harvester Configuration"},{"location":"install/harvester-configuration/#configuration-example","text":"Harvester configuration file can be provided during manual or automatic installation to configure various settings.

If the iPXE firmware is not available for your NIC card, the iPXE firmware images can be loaded from the TFTP server first. To see sample iPXE scripts, please visit Harvester iPXE Examples . Prerequisite \u00b6 Important Nodes need to have at least 8G of RAM because the installer loads the full ISO file into tmpfs. Preparing HTTP Servers \u00b6 An HTTP server is required to serve boot files. Let's assume the NGINX HTTP server's IP is 10.100.0.10 , and it serves the /usr/share/nginx/html/ directory with the path http://10.100.0.10/ .

DHCP Server Configuration \u00b6 The following is an example of how to configure the ISC DHCP server to offer iPXE scripts: option architecture-type code 93 = unsigned integer 16 ; subnet 10 .100.0.0 netmask 255 .255.255.0 { option routers 10 .100.0.10 ; option domain-name-servers 192 .168.2.1 ; range 10 .100.0.100 10 .100.0.253 ; } group { # create group if exists user-class and option user-class = \"iPXE\" { # iPXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create-efi\" ; } else { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create\" ; } } else { # PXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { # UEFI filename \"ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # Non-UEFI filename \"undionly.kpxe\" ; } } host node1 { hardware ethernet 52 :54:00:6b:13:e2 ; } } group { # join group if exists user-class and option user-class = \"iPXE\" { # iPXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-join-efi\" ; } else { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-join\" ; } } else { # PXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { # UEFI filename \"ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # Non-UEFI filename \"undionly.kpxe\" ; } } host node2 { hardware ethernet 52 :54:00:69:d5:92 ; } } The config file declares a subnet and two groups. The first group is for hosts to boot using CREATE mode and the other one is for JOIN mode. By default, the iPXE path is chosen, but if it sees a PXE client it offers the iPXE image according to the client architecture. Please prepare those images and a TFTP server first. Harvester Configuration \u00b6 For more information about Harvester configuration, please refer to the Harvester configuration page. Users can also provide configuration via kernel parameters. For example, to specify the CREATE install mode, users can pass the harvester.install.mode=create kernel parameter when booting. Values passed through kernel parameters have higher priority than values specified in the config file. UEFI HTTP Boot support \u00b6 UEFI firmware supports loading a boot image from an HTTP server. This section demonstrates how to use UEFI HTTP boot to load the iPXE program and perform an automatic installation. Serve the iPXE Program \u00b6 Download the iPXE UEFI program from http://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.efi and make sure ipxe.efi can be downloaded from the HTTP server. For example: cd /usr/share/nginx/html/harvester/ wget http://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.efi The file now can be downloaded from http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe.efi locally. DHCP Server Configuration \u00b6 If the user plans to use the UEFI HTTP boot feature by getting a dynamic IP first, the DHCP server needs to provide the iPXE program URL when it sees such a request. The following is an updated ISC DHCP server group example: group { # create group if exists user-class and option user-class = \"iPXE\" { # iPXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create-efi\" ; } else { filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create\" ; } } elsif substring ( option vendor-class-identifier, 0 , 10 ) = \"HTTPClient\" { # UEFI HTTP Boot option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\" ; filename \"http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # PXE Boot if option architecture-type = 00 :07 { # UEFI filename \"ipxe.efi\" ; } else { # Non-UEFI filename \"undionly.kpxe\" ; } } host node1 { hardware ethernet 52 :54:00:6b:13:e2 ; } } The elsif substring statement is new, and it offers http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe.efi when it sees a UEFI HTTP boot DHCP request. After the client fetches the iPXE program and runs it, the iPXE program will send a DHCP request again and load the iPXE script from the URL http://10.100.0.10/harvester/ipxe-create-efi . The iPXE Script for UEFI Boot \u00b6 It's mandatory to specify the initrd image for UEFI boot in the kernel parameters. The following is an updated version of iPXE script for CREATE mode. #!ipxe kernel harvester-<version>-vmlinuz initrd=harvester-<version>-initrd ip=dhcp net.ifnames=1 rd.cos.disable rd.noverifyssl console=tty1 root=live:http://10.100.0.10/harvester/rootfs.squashfs harvester.install.automatic=true harvester.install.config_url=http://10.100.0.10/harvester/config-create.yaml initrd harvester-<version>-initrd boot The parameter initrd=harvester-<version>-initrd is required. Useful Kernel Parameters \u00b6 Besides the Harvester configuration, you can also specify other kernel parameters that are useful in different scenarios. See also dracut.cmdline(7) . ip=dhcp \u00b6 If you have multiple network interfaces, you could add the ip=dhcp parameter to get IP from the DHCP server from all interfaces. rd.net.dhcp.retry=<cnt> \u00b6 Failing to get IP from the DHCP server would cause iPXE booting to fail. You can add parameter rd.net.dhcp.retry=<cnt> to retry DHCP request for <cnt> times.","title":"PXE Boot Installation"},{"location":"install/pxe-boot-install/#pxe-boot-installation","text":"Starting from version 0.2.0 , Harvester can be installed automatically.

We have implemented the Harvester VLAN network based on the bridge CNI to provide a pure L2-mode network, that would bridge your VMs to the host network interface and can be connected using the physical switch for both internal and external network communication. Moreover, the Harvester UI integrates the harvester-network-controller to provide user-friendly VLAN network configurations, e.g., to create and manage VLAN networks or to add a VLAN network to the VM. Currently, Harvester supports two types of networks: Management Network VLAN Network Management Network \u00b6 Harvester uses canal as its default management network. It is a built-in network that can be used directly from the cluster. By default, the management network IP of a VM can only be accessed within the cluster nodes, and the management network IP will change after the VM reboot. This is non-typical behaviour that needs to be taken note of since VM IPs are expected to remain unchanged after a reboot. However, users can leverage the Kubernetes service object to create a stable IP for your VMs with the management network. VLAN Network \u00b6 The Harvester network-controller leverages the multus and bridge CNI plugins to implement its customized L2 bridge VLAN network. It helps to connect your VMs to the host network interface and can be accessed from internal and external networks using the physical switch. The below diagram illustrates how the VLAN network works in Harvester. The Harvester network-controller creates a bridge for each node and a pair of veth for each VM to implement its VLAN network. The bridge acts as a switch to forward the network traffic from or to VMs and the veth pair is like the connected ports between VMs and the switch. VMs within the same VLAN can communicate with each other, while the VMs from different VLANs can't. The external switch ports connected to the hosts or other devices (such as the DHCP server) should be set as trunk or hybrid type and permit the specified VLANs. Users can use VLAN with PVID (default 1) to communicate with any normal untagged traffic. Enabling Default VLAN Network \u00b6 You can enable VLAN network via Settings > vlan . Select enabled and you will be able to select one network interface from the nodes as the default VLAN NIC config. For better network performances and isolation, we recommend to choose different network interfaces for the VLAN and the one used for the management network (i.e., harvester-mgmt ). Note When selecting the network interface, the value in parentheses represents the distribution percentage of the network interface on all hosts. If a network interface with a value less than 100% is selected, the network interface needs to be manually specified on the host where the VLAN network configuration fails. Modifying the default VLAN network setting will not update the existing configured host network. Harvester VLAN network supports bond interfaces. Currently it can only be created automatically via PXE Boot Configuration . You may also login to the node and create it manually. You can also customize each node's VLAN network via the Hosts > Network tab. Create a VLAN Network \u00b6 A new VLAN network can be created via the Advanced > Networks page and clicking the Create button. Specify the name and VLAN ID that you want to create for the VLAN network (You can specify the same vlan ID on different namespaces of Rancher multi-tenancy support) . Configure a route in order to allow the hosts to connect to the VLAN network using IPv4 addresses. The CIDR and gateway of the VLAN network are mandatory parameters for the route configuration. You can configure the route by choosing one of the following options: auto(DHCP) mode: the Harvester network controller will get the CIDR and gateway values from the DHCP server using the DHCP protocol. Optionally, you can specify the DHCP server address. manual mode: You need to specify the CIDR and gateway values manually. Create a VM with VLAN Network \u00b6 Users can now create a new VM using the above configured VLAN network, Click the Create button on the Virtual Machines page. Specify the required parameters and click the Networks tab. Either configure the default network to be a VLAN network or select an additional network to add. Note Only the first NIC will be enabled by default. Users can either choose to use a management network or a VLAN network. You need to be careful to configure virtual machines with multiple NICs to avoid connectivity issues. You can refer to the knowledge base for more details. You will need to select the Install guest agent option in the Advanced Options tab to get the VLAN network IP address from the Harvester UI. You can choose to add one or multiple network interface cards. The additional network interface cards can be enabled by default via the cloud-init network data setting. e.g., version : 1 config : - type : physical name : enp1s0 # name is varies upon OS image subnets : - type : dhcp - type : physical name : enp2s0 subnets : - type : static address : 10.0.0.100/24 # IP address is varies upon your environment Harvester is fully compatible with the cloud-init network configs . You can refer to the documentation for more details. Note If you add additional NICs after the VM has started, you will need to manually configure IPs for the additional NICs. Configure DHCP servers on Networks \u00b6 By default, the Harvester VLAN network would expect your router to provide a DHCP server that VMs can request and assign IP addresses automatically. If you are running Harvester in a virtual environment that does not contain a DHCP server, you may consider deploying a DHCP server manually on a node or using a containerized method, e.g, like #947 .","title":"Harvester Network"},{"location":"networking/harvester-network/#harvester-network","text":"Harvester is built on top of Kubernetes and leverages its built-in CNI mechanism to provide the interface between network providers and its VM networks.

Harvester provides load balancer and cluster Persistent Storage support to the guest Kubernetes cluster. In this page we will learn: How to deploy the Harvester cloud provider in both RKE1 and RKE2. How to use the Harvester load balancer . Deploying \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 The Kubernetes cluster is built on top of Harvester virtual machines. The Harvester virtual machines run as guest Kubernetes nodes are in the same namespace. Deploying to the RKE1 Cluster with Harvester Node Driver \u00b6 When spinning up an RKE cluster using the Harvester node driver, you can perform two steps to deploy the Harvester cloud provider: Select Harvester(Out-of-tree) option. Install Harvester Cloud Provider from the Rancher marketplace. Note You should specify the Cluster name . The default value kubernetes will be set if no Cluster name is entered. The Cluster name is used to distinguish the ownership of the Harvester load balancers. Install Harvester csi driver from the Rancher marketplace if needed. Deploying to the RKE2 Cluster with Harvester Node Driver [Experimental] \u00b6 When spinning up an RKE2 cluster using the Harvester node driver, select the Harvester cloud provider. The node driver will then help deploy both the CSI driver and CCM automatically. Deploying to the K3s Cluster with Harvester Node Driver [Experimental] \u00b6 Choose the Kubernetes version to be k3s and click the Edit as YAML button to config the K3s cluster YAML (For existing cluster, you can also click the Edit YAML button to update it): Edit K3s cluster YAML. Set disable-cloud-provider: true to disable default k3s cloud provider. Add cloud-provider=external to use harvester cloud provider. Generate addon configuration and put it in K3s VMs /etc/kubernetes/cloud-config . Deploy external cloud provider \u00b6 Deploying external cloud provider is similar for both RKE2 and K3s based clusters. Once the in-tree cloud provider has been disabled by following the above steps, you can deploy the external cloud provider via: A sample additional manifest is as follows: apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChart metadata: name: harvester-cloud-provider namespace: kube-system spec: targetNamespace: kube-system bootstrap: true repo: https://charts.harvesterhci.io/ chart: harvester-cloud-provider version: 0.1.12 helmVersion: v3 The cloud provider needs a kubeconfig file to work, a limited scoped one can be generated using the generate_addon.sh script available in the harvester/cloud-provider-harvester repo.

With these settings in place a K3s / RKE2 cluster should provision successfully while using the external cloud provider. Load Balancer Support \u00b6 After deploying the Harvester Cloud provider , you can use the Kubernetes LoadBalancer service to expose a microservice inside the guest cluster to the external world. When you create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service, a Harvester load balancer is assigned to the service and you can edit it through the Add-on Config in the Rancher UI. IPAM \u00b6 Harvester's built-in load balancer supports both pool and dhcp modes. You can select the mode in the Rancher UI. Harvester adds the annotation cloudprovider.harvesterhci.io/ipam to the service behind. pool: You should configure an IP address pool in Harvester in advance. The Harvester LoadBalancer controller will allocate an IP address from the IP address pool for the load balancer. dhcp: A DHCP server is required. The Harvester LoadBalancer controller will request an IP address from the DHCP server. Note It is not allowed to modify the IPAM mode. You need to create a new service if you want to modify the IPAM mode. Health Checks \u00b6 The Harvester load balancer supports TCP health checks. You can specify the parameters in the Rancher UI if you enable the Health Check option. Alternatively, you can specify the parameters by adding annotations to the service manually. The following annotations are supported: Annotation Key Value Type Required Description cloudprovider.harvesterhci.io/healthcheck-port string true Specifies the port. The prober will access the address composed of the backend server IP and the port. cloudprovider.harvesterhci.io/healthcheck-success-threshold string false Specifies the health check success threshold. The default value is 1. The backend server will start forwarding traffic if the number of times the prober continuously detects an address successfully reaches the threshold. cloudprovider.harvesterhci.io/healthcheck-failure-threshold string false Specifies the health check failure threshold. The default value is 3. The backend server will stop forwarding traffic if the number of health check failures reaches the threshold. cloudprovider.harvesterhci.io/healthcheck-periodseconds string false Specifies the health check period.

As a prerequisite, Harvester v1.0.0 integration requires Rancher server v2.6.3 or above. In production, use one of the following guides to deploy and provision Rancher and a Kubernetes cluster with the provider of your choice: AWS (uses Terraform) AWS Marketplace (uses Amazon EKS) Azure (uses Terraform) DigitalOcean (uses Terraform) GCP (uses Terraform) Hetzner Cloud (uses Terraform) Vagrant Equinix Metal Warning Do not install Rancher with Docker in production . Otherwise, your environment may be damaged and your cluster may not be recovered. Installing Rancher in Docker should only be used for quick evaluation and testing purposes. To install Rancher with Docker: Begin creation of a custom cluster by provisioning a Linux host. Your host can be any of the following: A cloud-hosted virtual machine (VM) An on-premises VM A bare-metal server Log into your Linux host using your preferred shell, such as PuTTy or a remote terminal connection. From your shell, enter the following command: # for a quick evaluation, you can run the Rancher server with the following command $ sudo docker run -d --restart = unless-stopped -p 80 :80 -p 443 :443 --privileged rancher/rancher:v2.6.3 Once the Rancher server is up and running, log in and click the hamburger menu and choose the Virtualization Management tab. Select Import Existing to import the downstream Harvester cluster into the Rancher server. Specify the Cluster Name and click Create . You will then see the registration guide; please open the dashboard of the target Harvester cluster and follow the guide accordingly. Once the agent node is ready, you should be able to view and access the imported Harvester cluster from the Rancher server and manage your VMs accordingly. From the Harvester UI, you can click the hamburger menu to navigate back to the Rancher multi-cluster management page. Multi-Tenancy \u00b6 In Harvester, we have leveraged the existing Rancher RBAC authorization such that users can view and manage a set of resources based on their cluster and project role permissions. Within Rancher, each person authenticates as a user, which is a login that grants a user access to Rancher. As mentioned in Authentication , users can either be local or external. Once the user logs into Rancher, their authorization, also known as access rights, is determined by global permissions and cluster and project roles. Global Permissions : Define user authorization outside the scope of any particular cluster. Cluster and Project Roles : Define user authorization inside the specific cluster or project where users are assigned the role. Both global permissions and cluster and project roles are implemented on top of Kubernetes RBAC . Therefore, enforcement of permissions and roles is performed by Kubernetes. A cluster owner has full control over the cluster and all resources inside it, e.g., hosts, VMs, volumes, images, networks, backups, and settings. A project user can be assigned to a specific project with permission to manage the resources inside the project. Multi-Tenancy Example \u00b6 The following example provides a good explanation of how the multi-tenant feature works: First, add new users via the Rancher Users & Authentication page. Then click Create to add two new separated users, such as project-owner and project-readonly respectively. A project-owner is a user with permission to manage a list of resources of a particular project, e.g., the default project. A project-readonly is a user with read-only permission of a particular project, e.g., the default project. Click one of the imported Harvester clusters after navigating to the Harvester UI. Click the Projects/Namespaces tab. Select a project such as default and click the Edit Config menu to assign the users to this project with appropriate permissions. For example, the project-owner user will be assigned the project owner role. Continue to add the project-readonly user to the same project with read-only permissions and click Save . Open an incognito browser and log in as project-owner . After logging in as the project-owner user, click the Virtualization Management tab. There you should be able to view the cluster to which you have been assigned. Click the Images tab to view a list of images previously uploaded to the harvester-public namespace. You can also upload your own image if needed. Create a VM with one of the images that you have uploaded. Log in with another user, e.g., project-readonly , and this user will only have the read permission of this project.

You can click the version in the support matrix table to see if there are any known issues. Dive into the upgrade design proposal . The following section briefly describes phases within an upgrade and possible diagnostic methods. Diagnose the upgrade flow \u00b6 A Harvester upgrade process contains several phases. Phase 1: Provision upgrade repository VM. \u00b6 The Harvester controller downloads a Harvester release ISO file and uses it to provision a VM. During this phase you can see the upgrade status windows show: The time to complete the phase depends on the user's network speed and cluster resource utilization. We see failures in this phase due to network speed. If this happens, the user can start over the upgrade again. We can also check the repository VM (named with the format upgrade-repo-hvst-xxxx ) status and its corresponding pod: $ kubectl get vm -n harvester-system NAME AGE STATUS READY upgrade-repo-hvst-upgrade-9gmg2 101s Starting False $ kubectl get pods -n harvester-system | grep upgrade-repo-hvst virt-launcher-upgrade-repo-hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-4mnmq 1/1 Running 0 4m44s Phase 2: Preload container images \u00b6 The Harvester controller creates jobs on each Harvester node to download images from the repository VM and preload them. These are the container images required for the next release. During this stage you can see the upgrade status windows shows: It will take a while for all nodes to preload images. If the upgrade fails at this phase, the user can check job logs in the cattle-system namespace: $ kubectl get jobs -n cattle-system | grep prepare apply-hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-prepare-on-node1-with-2bbea1599a-f0e86 0/1 47s 47s apply-hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-prepare-on-node4-with-2bbea1599a-041e4 1/1 2m3s 2m50s $ kubectl logs jobs/apply-hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-prepare-on-node1-with-2bbea1599a-f0e86 -n cattle-system ... It's also safe to start over the upgrade if an upgrade fails at this phase. Phase 3: Upgrade system services \u00b6 In this phase, Harvester controller upgrades component Helm charts with a job. The user can check the apply-manifest job with the following command: $ kubectl get jobs -n harvester-system -l harvesterhci.io/upgradeComponent=manifest NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-apply-manifests 0/1 46s 46s $ kubectl logs jobs/hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-apply-manifests -n harvester-system ... Phase 4: Upgrade nodes \u00b6 The Harvester controller creates jobs on each node (one by one) to upgrade nodes' OSes and RKE2 runtime. For multi-node clusters, there are two kinds of jobs to update a node: pre-drain job: live-migrate or shutdown VMs on a node. When the job completes, the embedded Rancher service upgrades RKE2 runtime on a node. post-drain job: upgrade OS and reboot. For single-node clusters, there is only one single-node-upgrade type job for each node (named with the format hvst-upgrade-xxx-single-node-upgrade-<hostname> ). The user can check node jobs by: $ kubectl get jobs -n harvester-system -l harvesterhci.io/upgradeComponent=node NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-post-drain-node1 1/1 118s 6m34s hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-post-drain-node2 0/1 9s 9s hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-pre-drain-node1 1/1 3s 8m14s hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-pre-drain-node2 1/1 7s 85s $ kubectl logs -n harvester-system jobs/hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-post-drain-node2 ... Warning Please do not start over an upgrade if the upgrade fails at this phase. Phase 5: Clean-up \u00b6 The Harvester controller deletes the upgrade repository VM and all files that are no longer needed. Common operations \u00b6 Start over an upgrade \u00b6 Log in to a control plane node. List Upgrade CRs in the cluster: # become root $ sudo -i # list the on-going upgrade $ kubectl get upgrade.harvesterhci.io -n harvester-system -l harvesterhci.io/latestUpgrade=true NAME AGE hvst-upgrade-9gmg2 10m Delete the Upgrade CR $ kubectl delete hvst-upgrade-9gmg2 -n harvester-system Click the upgrade button in the Harvester dashboard to start an upgrade again.","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"upgrade/troubleshooting/#troubleshooting","text":"","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"upgrade/troubleshooting/#overview","text":"Here are some tips to troubleshoot a failed upgrade: Check version-specific upgrade notes .

If the VGA display is not enabled on the VM, as with the Ubuntu-minimal-cloud image, the VM can only be accessed with the serial console. SSH Access \u00b6 Harvester provides two ways to inject SSH public keys into virtual machines. Generally, these methods fall into two categories. Static key injection , which places keys in the cloud-init script when the virtual machine is first powered on; dynamic injection , which allows keys or basic auth to be updated dynamically at runtime. Static SSH Key Injection via cloud-init \u00b6 You can provide ssh keys to your virtual machines during the creation time on the Basics tab.

Note Please refer to this page for creating Windows virtual machines. Choose the option to create either one or multiple VM instances. Select the namespace of your VMs, only the harvester-public namespace is visible to all users. The VM Name is a required field. (Optional) VM template is optional, you can choose iso-image , raw-image or windows-iso-image template to speed up your VM instance creation. Configure the virtual machine's CPU and memory (see overcommit settings if you want to over-provision). Select SSH keys or upload new keys. Select a custom VM image on the Volumes tab. The default disk will be the root disk. You can add more disks to the VM. To configure networks, go to the Networks tab. The Management Network is added by default, you can remove it if the VLAN network is configured. You can also add additional networks to the VMs using VLAN networks. You may configure the VLAN networks on Advanced > Networks first. Advanced options such as run strategy, os type and cloud-init data are optional. You may configure these in the Advanced Options section when applicable. Volumes \u00b6 You can add one or more additional volumes via the Volumes tab, by default the first disk will be the root disk, you can change the boot order by dragging and dropping volumes, or using the arrow buttons. A disk can be made accessible via the following types: type description disk A disk disk will expose the volume as an ordinary disk to the VM. cd-rom A cd-rom disk will expose the volume as a cd-rom drive to the VM. It is read-only by default. Container Disk Container disks are ephemeral storage devices that can be assigned to any number of VMs. This makes them an ideal tool for users who want to replicate a large number of VM workloads or inject machine drivers that do not require persistent data. Note: Container disks are not a good solution for any workload that requires persistent root disks across VM restarts. Networks \u00b6 You can choose to add both the management network or VLAN network to your VM instances via the Networks tab, the management network is optional if you have the VLAN network configured. Network interfaces are configured through the Type field. They describe the properties of the virtual interfaces seen inside the guest OS: type description bridge Connect using a Linux bridge masquerade Connect using iptables rules to NAT the traffic Management Network \u00b6 A management network represents the default VM eth0 interface configured by the cluster network solution that is present in each VM. By default, VMs are accessible through the management network within the cluster nodes. Secondary Network \u00b6 It is also possible to connect VMs using additional networks with Harvester's built-in VLAN networks . In bridge VLAN, virtual machines are connected to the host network through a linux bridge . The network IPv4 address is delegated to the virtual machine via DHCPv4. The virtual machine should be configured to use DHCP to acquire IPv4 addresses. Advanced Options \u00b6 Run Strategy \u00b6 Available as of v1.0.2 Prior to v1.0.2, Harvester used the Running (a boolean) field to determine if the VM instance should be running. However, a simple boolean value is not always sufficient to fully describe the user's desired behavior. For example, in some cases the user wants to be able to shut down the instance from inside the virtual machine. If the running field is used, the VM will be restarted immediately. In order to meet the scenario requirements of more users, the RunStrategy field is introduced. This is mutually exclusive with Running because their conditions overlap somewhat. There are currently four RunStrategies defined: Always: The VM instance will always exist. If VM instance crashes, a new one will be spawned. This is the same behavior as Running: true . RerunOnFailure (default): If the previous instance failed in an error state, a VM instance will be respawned. If the guest is successfully stopped (e.g. shut down from inside the guest), it will not be recreated. Manual: The presence or absence of a VM instance is controlled only by the start/stop/restart VirtualMachine actions. Stop: There will be no VM instance. If the guest is already running, it will be stopped. This is the same behavior as Running: false . Cloud Configuration \u00b6 Harvester supports the ability to assign a startup script to a virtual machine instance which is executed automatically when the VM initializes. These scripts are commonly used to automate injection of users and SSH keys into VMs in order to provide remote access to the machine. For example, a startup script can be used to inject credentials into a VM that allows an Ansible job running on a remote host to access and provision the VM. Cloud-init \u00b6 Cloud-init is a widely adopted project and the industry standard multi-distribution method for cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all major cloud image provider like SUSE, Redhat, Ubuntu and etc., cloud-init has established itself as the defacto method of providing startup scripts to VMs. Harvester supports injecting your custom cloud-init startup scripts into a VM instance through the use of an ephemeral disk. VMs with the cloud-init package installed will detect the ephemeral disk and execute custom user-data and network-data scripts at boot. Example of password configuration for the default user: #cloud-config password : password chpasswd : { expire : False } ssh_pwauth : True Example of network-data configuration using DHCP: version : 1 config : - type : physical name : eth0 subnets : - type : dhcp - type : physical name : eth1 subnets : - type : dhcp You can also use the Advanced > Cloud Config Templates feature to create a pre-defined cloud-init configuration template for the VM. Installing the QEMU guest agent \u00b6 The QEMU guest agent is a daemon that runs on the virtual machine instance and passes information to the host about the VM, users, file systems, and secondary networks. Install guest agent checkbox is enabled by default when a new VM is created.

By setting overcommit-config , this will allow scheduling of additional virtual machines even when physical resources are fully utilized. Harvester allows you to overcommit CPU and RAM on compute nodes. This allows you to increase the number of instances running on your cloud at the cost of reducing the performance of the instances. The Compute service uses the following ratios by default: CPU allocation ratio: 1600% RAM allocation ratio: 150% Storage allocation ratio: 200% Note Classic memory overcommitment or memory ballooning is not yet supported by this feature. In other words, memory used by a virtual machine instance cannot be returned once allocated. Configure the global setting overcommit-config \u00b6 Users can modify the global overcommit-config by following the steps below, and it will be applied to each newly created virtual machine after the change. Go to the Advanced > Settings page. Find the overcommit-config setting. Configure the desired CPU, Memory, and Storage ratio. Configure overcommit for a single virtual machine \u00b6 If you need to configure individual virtual machines without involving global configuration, consider adjusting the spec.template.spec.domain.resources.<memory|cpu> value on the target VirtualMachine resource individually.

In most cases, this will not cause any problems. However, some operating systems, such as Windows 2022, will request more memory than is reserved. To address the issue, Harvester provides an annotation harvesterhci.io/reservedMemory on VirtualMachine custom resource to let you specify the amount of memory to reserve.
